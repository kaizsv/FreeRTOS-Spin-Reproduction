How to decide the spinning value?

* We spin the plug task by querying the SysTick cycle count
  (QconsB3.c:19 and QProdB2.c: 18).
* If the spinning value is SystemCoreClock, there is no spinning.

1. At first, the spinning value is initialized to SystemCoreClock.
2. Decide a victim to be starved, for example, QConsB3.
3. Compile the program and flash to a STM32F429 board.
   Also, run openocd and gdb in separate terminals.
4. In GDB, watch the pointer pxCurrentTCB until pxCurrentTCB points to the victim.
5. Read DWT->CYCCNT. Assign the value to the spinning variable.
   This make the SysTick interrupt the execution of the scheduler while the
   victim is selected by the scheduler.
6. Compile the program and flash to a STM32F429 board.
   Observe the on-board LED.
7. If no error occurs, we need to change the spinning value while execution.
   Do step 3 again.
8. If an error occurs, use GDB to check the error information.
